# Predicting Payment Default with XGBoost and SHAP

Welcome to the Predicting Payment Default project! This initiative focuses on developing a robust machine learning pipeline to predict payment defaults based on historical client data. By leveraging numerical data and advanced interpretability tools like SHAP, the project aims to assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk clients and enabling proactive risk management strategies.

## Project Overview

### üîπ Feature Engineering & Model Implementation
This project emphasizes the creation of predictive features and addresses class imbalance to improve recall for identifying high-risk clients.

**Techniques Used:**
- Feature engineering (e.g., average payment delay, payment trends)
- Class imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling)
- XGBoost for its robustness and high-performance capabilities

**Objective:**
Develop a production-ready model optimized for recall and capable of accurate risk classification.

### üîπ Model Explainability with SHAP
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are utilized to provide both global and individual-level explanations for model predictions.

**Key Features:**
- SHAP Summary Plots: Highlight overall feature importance.
- SHAP Dependence Plots: Show feature impacts on predictions.
- SHAP Force Plots: Provide individual-level explanations for decision-making.

**Objective:**
Ensure model predictions are interpretable and actionable for stakeholders.

### üîπ Model Fairness Testing
The project incorporates fairness testing to ensure unbiased predictions across diverse client groups.

**Techniques Used:**
- Fairness testing libraries
- Evaluation of biases and mitigation strategies

**Objective:**
Build a model that is fair and equitable for all client demographics.

### üîπ Deployment
The final model is deployed in a production environment, enabling real-time predictions for new clients.
